## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

To make the design look exact as was desired. Small changes in the design also gives it a newer and better look. Glassmorphism technique is used in the nav bar which gives it altogether a new look. Added the below code to make it more appealing and effective 
```css
background: rgba(243, 240, 236, 0.1);
		box-shadow: 0 4px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
		backdrop-filter: blur(25px);
		-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(25px);
		margin-top:2%;
		float:right;
		margin-right:-7px;
		color:white;
		padding:35px 60px 0px 60px;
  
```

### Continued development

I would futher like to enhance the site by making it more informative. Also would like to add animations to all active state buttons in the landing page.
